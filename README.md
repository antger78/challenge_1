Module 1 Challenge: HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

Original code sourced from class repository, with modifications from Anthony Geritano Jr., with colaboration from Ron Erlih.

# Description

The files in the github repository come together to form an interactive webpage that serves to functionally describe the fictional company "Horiseon." The company's website already existed and therefore my job was to make the site more accessible for users.  In order to do so, I first consolidated a number of the CSS elements to clean up the websites code, and renamed several of the site's semantic HTML elements in order to make a search engine or web reader have an easier time navigating the website. Several of the comments with my train of thought were left in to show the grader how I came to my decisions and even left in some stylistic choices that I would like to talk to the client for clarification on before making a change one way or the other as well as some open questions.  I look forward to some feedback!
